AI is a bit like a new kid on the tech block---everyone's talking about it, but not everyone knows how to handle it.

For local authorities, deciding which AI technology to bring on board is like trying to pick a winner in a game of horseshoes while blindfolded. The problem? There aren't enough signposts from the central government to guide the way.

The Struggle with AI Procurement
--------------------------------

Local authorities are facing a big headache: How do you choose the right AI technology? The United Kingdom's central government is keen on pushing AI adoption, but it seems they've forgotten to draft a user manual for local councils. According to the Ada Lovelace Institute, despite 16 government publications between 2010 and 2024, there's not much clear advice to help local government folks make well-informed choices.

Why Does Guidance Matter?
-------------------------

Think of AI technology like a sharp tool: if you don't know how to use it, you might end up with a nasty cut---or worse. Imogen Parker from the Ada Lovelace Institute puts it well: "It's essential that the procurers in the public sector are confident about the products they are buying in -- and neither they nor the public are put at risk."

Without guidance, there's a risk of choosing AI systems that may be unfair, harmful, or just plain useless. And that's not a chance anyone wants to take.

Learning from Past Mistakes
---------------------------

Remember the Post Office Horizon scandal? It was a significant blunder that taught us what happens when technology isn't used ethically. The Ada Lovelace Institute warns that ignoring ethics in AI procurement could lead to similar disasters. They emphasize that procurement processes should grill AI developers about the safety and fairness of their solutions before making any commitments.

Why Ethics in AI is Critical
----------------------------

Anna Studman, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, warns that AI tools could severely damage public trust if not properly scrutinized. AI can sometimes be like a bad psychic: its predictions might be wild and based on little to no understanding of reality. Authorities need to make sure AI systems don't end up being discriminatory or simply ineffective.

Ethical procurement isn't just nice to have; it's essential. It ensures the AI tools used are safe, effective, and align with the public interest.

The Call to Action
------------------

The Ada Lovelace Institute suggests several steps to smooth the rocky road of AI procurement for local authorities:

1.  **Clear Guidance Needed:** The central government needs to create detailed and easily understandable guidelines focusing on ethical AI use, transparency, and risk management.

2.  **Building Capacity:** Local authorities need training and resources to handle AI procurement confidently and ethically.

3.  **Work Together:** Collaboration is key. Central and local governments should team up, along with civil society organizations, to ensure AI is implemented responsibly in the public sector.

Wrapping Up
-----------

In the world of tech, AI might be the future, but without a proper roadmap, local authorities can get lost. The message is clear: we need to focus on ethical procurement and ensure that AI works for everyone, not against them. It's high time the central government steps up its game and provides the guidance needed to make future AI procurement a win for local councils and the people they serve.
